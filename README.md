This project provides a framework for speech-to-text (STT) conversion, text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and an AI agent that processes data using a Jupyter notebook. The system is designed to handle audio input, convert it to text, process it with an AI agent, and generate spoken output.

Overview
The project consists of three main components:
1. Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts audio input into text using a speech recognition model.
2. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Synthesizes text into spoken audio output.
3. AI Agent Notebook: A Jupyter notebook containing data and logic for an AI agent to process input and generate responses.
 
This system can be used for applications like voice assistants, automated transcription, or interactive AI systems.
 
Features
- Converts audio files or real-time audio to text.
- Generates natural-sounding speech from text input.
- AI agent processes text data and performs tasks defined in the notebook.
- Modular design for easy integration with other systems.
 
Requirements
This project is built and executed entirely within Azure Databricks.
 
- Platform
Azure Databricks Workspace (Unity Catalog enabled)
Databricks Runtime: 13.3 LTS or later (compatible with your code)
 
- Access & Permissions
Access to Databricks SQL Editor and Workspace Notebooks
 
- Sufficient privileges to:
Create/modify catalogs, schemas, tables, and functions
Use Unity Catalog and associated data assets

- stt.py: Contains the logic for converting audio to text using a speech recognition library.
- tts.py: Contains the logic for converting text to speech using a TTS engine.
- agent_notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook with data and logic for the AI agent, including data processing and response generation.
 
Usage
1. Speech-to-Text:
   - To convert an audio file to text:
python stt.py --input data/sample_audio.wav
   - For real-time microphone input:
python stt.py --mic
 
2. Text-to-Speech:
   - To convert text to speech:
python tts.py --text "Hello, this is a test." --output data/output_audio.wav
   - To use a text file as input:
python tts.py --file data/input_text.txt --output data/output_audio.wav
 
3. AI Agent:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook:
     jupyter notebook agent_notebook.ipynb
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, configure the agent, and process inputs.
   - The notebook may include sample datasets or logic to interact with STT/TTS outputs.
 
4. End-to-End Example:
   - Convert audio to text, process it with the AI agent, and generate spoken output:
python stt.py --input data/sample_audio.wav --output data/transcribed_text.txt
     jupyter notebook agent_notebook.ipynb  # Process transcribed_text.txt
python tts.py --file data/agent_output.txt --output data/final_audio.wav
