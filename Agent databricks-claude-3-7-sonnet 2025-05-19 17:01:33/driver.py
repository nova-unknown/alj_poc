# MAGIC #Tool-calling Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is an auto-generated notebook created by an AI Playground export.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook uses [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/build-genai-apps) to recreate your agent from the AI Playground. It  demonstrates how to develop, manually test, evaluate, log, and deploy a tool-calling agent in LangGraph.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The agent code implements [MLflow's ChatAgent](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatAgent) interface, a Databricks-recommended open-source standard that simplifies authoring multi-turn conversational agents, and is fully compatible with Mosaic AI agent framework functionality.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC  **_NOTE:_**  This notebook uses LangChain, but AI Agent Framework is compatible with any agent authoring framework, including LlamaIndex or pure Python agents written with the OpenAI SDK.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Prerequisites

# MAGIC %pip install -U -qqqq mlflow langchain langgraph==0.3.4 databricks-langchain pydantic databricks-agents unitycatalog-langchain[databricks] uv

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Define the agent in code
# MAGIC Below we define our agent code in a single cell, enabling us to easily write it to a local Python file for subsequent logging and deployment using the `%%writefile` magic command.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more examples of tools to add to your agent, see [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/agent-tool).

# MAGIC ### Log the `agent` as an MLflow model
# MAGIC Determine Databricks resources to specify for automatic auth passthrough at deployment time
# MAGIC - **TODO**: If your Unity Catalog tool queries a [vector search index](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/unstructured-retrieval-tools) or leverages [external functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/external-connection-tools), you need to include the dependent vector search index and UC connection objects, respectively, as resources. See [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/log-agent#specify-resources-for-automatic-authentication-passthrough) for more details.

# MAGIC ## Perform pre-deployment validation of the agent
# MAGIC Before registering and deploying the agent, we perform pre-deployment checks via the [mlflow.models.predict()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.models.html#mlflow.models.predict) API. See [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/machine-learning/model-serving/model-serving-debug#validate-inputs) for details

# COMMAND ----------

mlflow.models.predict(
    model_uri=f"runs:/{logged_agent_info.run_id}/agent",
    input_data={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]},
    env_manager="uv",

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Register the model to Unity Catalog
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Update the `catalog`, `schema`, and `model_name` below to register the MLflow model to Unity Catalog.

# COMMAND ----------

mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")

# TODO: define the catalog, schema, and model name for your UC model
catalog = "datalink"
schema = "lineagedemo"
model_name = "alj_cc_agent"

# MAGIC ## Next steps
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After your agent is deployed, you can chat with it in AI playground to perform additional checks, share it with SMEs in your organization for feedback, or embed it in a production application. See [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/deploy-agent) for details
